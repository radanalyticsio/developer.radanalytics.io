= Why am I getting java.io.IOException: failure to login from org.apache.hadoop.security.UserGroupInformation.loginUserFromSubject?

The underlying Apache Spark code uses Apache Hadoop code to lookup the current
user name, which fails. It fails because containers in OpenShift run as an
ephemeral uid for security purposes, and that uid does not show up in
`/etc/passwd`. To address this, we have a custom entrypoint for
https://hub.docker.com/r/radanalyticsio/openshift-spark/[openshift-spark]
containers that uses https://cwrap.org/nss_wrapper.html[nss_wrapper] to add
the ephemeral uid to /etc/passwd before running any code. However, we cannot
provide coverage for all the ways that code can be run. Specifically,
`oc rsh` or `oc exec` will avoid our setup code. If you are using either of
those, please use `/entrypoint <your command>`.
