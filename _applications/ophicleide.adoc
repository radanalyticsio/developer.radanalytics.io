[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the Ophicleide Word2vec application.
Ophicleide is a cloud native application that provides users with an easy path
to train and query https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec[Word2vec] models
from their web browser.

Ophicleide can ingest text corpora from any URL it can reach through HTTP/S
protocols. Word2vec models are then trained from these texts, with the end
result being an interface to make single word queries against the models to
find other words in the corpora with similar vectors.

Throughout this document you will find these quickstart sections which
contain command line shortcuts for the console workflows and  procedures
described in the text.

[[architecture]]
== Architecture

The Ophicleide application suite is primarily composed of two microservice
containers:
https://github.com/ophicleide/ophicleide-training[ophicleide-training] and
https://github.com/ophicleide/ophicleide-web[ophicleide-web].

The ophicleide-training microservice is a Python and PySpark application that
receives training and query requests through a RESTful interface. It uses the
https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark] processing framework to perform
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec[Word2vec] calculations on text corpora
supplied by the user. The results of these calculations are stored as models in
a https://www.mongodb.com/[MongoDB] database.

The ophicleide-web microservice is a https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js]
application that communicates with the ophicleide-training REST interface, and
provides a graphical interface to users through their web  browser using
https://angularjs.org/[AngularJS] and
http://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly]. It allows users to create Word2vec
training models by supplying URLs containing the source corpora to be
processed, and to make single word similarity queries against those models.

The following diagram shows the overall architecture of the Ophicleide suite.

_Please note that the number of Spark containers and text data presented here
is for demonstration purposes, the actual numbers will differ depending on
your usage._

[[installation]]
== Installation

Installing the Ophicleide application suite is a relatively simple process
that mainly consists of creating a template in OpenShift and then launching
the application. There are a few prerequisites that must be accomplished
before Ophicleide can be launched.

In general, these steps can be summarized as:

1. Install prerequisities

2. Upload Ophicleide object list template

3. Launch Ophicleide

=== Prerequisites

Ophicleide requires a few services to accomplish its processing: an Apache
Spark cluster, and a MongoDB datastore.

1. To install an Apache Spark cluster into your OpenShift project, you should
  use one of the Oshinko related technologies. A quick start guide for getting
  these up and running can be found on the
  radanalytics.io link:/get-started[Get Started] page. You will need to
  record the Spark master URL from this deployment.

2. OpenShift includes a MongoDB template in its projects, you can read more
  about it in the
  https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/db_images/mongodb.html[OpenShift documentation on MongoDB images].
  Be sure to create a database named `ophicleide` when you deploy the MongoDB
  as the ophicleide-training component will use this database for storing its
  models and query results. You will need to record the MongoDB connection URL
  from this installation.

=== Ophicleide template

This template creates several objects in your OpenShift project. These
objects will direct the building and deployment of the entire application
suite.

For information on how to load this template into your OpenShift project,
please see the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html[OpenShift documentation on templates].

.Command line quickstart
****
The following command will install the Ophicleide template into OpenShift
....
oc create -f https://radanalytics.io/assets/ophicleide/ophicleide-setup-list.yaml
....
****

Let's examine the template and explore the various objects that are created.

link:/assets/ophicleide/ophicleide-setup-list.yaml[ophicleide-setup-list.yaml]

This template encapsulates a `List` object which is used to bundle together
the various components necessary for building and deploying Ophicleide. The
first two items are
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[Image Streams],
which are used to store the results of building the ophicleide-training and
ophicleide-web images for the application.

....
- kind: ImageStream
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: ophicleide-training
  spec: {}

- kind: ImageStream
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: ophicleide-web
  spec: {}
....

After the `ImageStream` objects, the template defines two build configurations
which inform OpenShift how to perform a
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#builds[Build]
of the related application components.

You will see that these `BuildConfig` objects each refer to a Git repository
containing the source code for the ophicleide-training and ophicleide-web
components. They also refer to the types of builds that will be performed and
the source Docker images to use as a starting point for those builds.

....
- kind: BuildConfig
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: ophicleide-training
  spec:
    source:
      type: Git
      git:
        uri: https://github.com/ophicleide/ophicleide-training
    strategy:
      type: Docker
    output:
      to:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: ophicleide-training:latest

- kind: BuildConfig
  apiVersion: v1
  metadata:
    name: ophicleide-web
  spec:
    source:
      type: Git
      git:
        uri: https://github.com/ophicleide/ophicleide-web
    strategy:
      type: Source
      sourceStrategy:
        from:
          kind: DockerImage
          name: centos/nodejs-4-centos7:latest
    output:
      to:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: ophicleide-web:latest
....

The final section of the list defines the `Template` object that will be used
by OpenShift to display the application in the "Add to Project" section of
the console, or with the command line client. The
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/templates.html#architecture-core-concepts-templates[OpenShift documentation on Templates]
provides an extended discussion of this type of object.

The template for Ophicleide defines two
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html#services[Services],
a https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[Route],
and a https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/deployments.html[Deployment].

The `Service` objects provide a useful way to expose the specific ports that
our application components need, and also define static names that can be used
as URIs within the project network.

The `Route` object associates a hostname with the service for the
ophicleide-web component's interface.

Finally, the `DeploymentConfig` instructs OpenShift how the containers of
our application should be deployed into our project. You will see that the
containers of this deployment will be based on the `ImageStreams` created
earlier, and that each container should be redeployed if either of those
images changes. You can also see how each container will need a few
environment variables and a port defined during their creation. These details
can be explored more fully by examining the source code for the Ophicleide
application components.

Finally, the `Template` contains a parameters section. This section instructs
OpenShift about variables that we may want to substitute in the final version
of the object. In the case of Ophicleide, there are 2 required and one
optional parameter. As noted earlier, the Spark master URL and MongoDB
connection string are required for Ophicleide to run, the optional
`WEB_ROUTE_HOSTNAME` is used to define a custom route hostname for the
ophicleide-web component.

=== Launching Ophicleide

With the Ophicleide objects loaded into your project, you are now ready to
begin the process of building and launching the application suite. Before
the Ophicleide components can be started though, their images must be built
and tagged as image streams in the project.

.Command line quickstart
****
The following commands will start building the Ophicleide components
....
oc start-build ophicleide-web
oc start-build ophicleide-training
....
****

Previously, the `ImageStream` objects were created to provide a location within
the project to store the built applications. Now you must build the
ophicleide-training and ophicleide-web images. This can be done by navigating
to the build section in the web console or by using the command line. For a
thorough discussion of starting a build, please see the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds.html#starting-a-build[OpenShift documentation on builds].

**Note** to complete the builds within your project, you will need to have
the `system:image-pusher` role on your account.

The build time for these images should be under 5 minutes, assuming there
are no connection issues. Information about the build process can be seen by
accessing the logs of either build.

With both images successfully built, you are now ready to launch the entire
application suite. As mentioned previously, you will need two pieces of
information to complete the launch: the Spark master URL, and the MongoDB
connection string.

.Command line quickstart
****
The following command will launch the Ophicleide application. You will need
to replace the `SPARK` and `MONGO` parameters with the values you have used
during your setup.
....
oc new-app --template ophicleide -p SPARK=spark://mycluster:7077 -p MONGO=mongodb://admin:admin@mongodb
....
****

Ophicleide can be launched by navigating to the "Add to Project" section of
your project, and then searching for `ophicleide` in the provided form. You
should see a screen similar to this:

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/addtoproject.png" alt="Add to project" class="img-responsive">]

Selecting the Ophicleide template will bring you to the following screen
which will allow the input of our connection strings and the actual launch:

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/launch.png" alt="Launch the app" class="img-responsive">]

You should now fill in the forms for the Spark master URL and the MongoDB
connection string, you may optionally add a route hostname. By default,
OpenShift will use a preconfigured value for the hostname of the route. It
will be determined by using the application name, project name, and a value
configured by the site administrator for the domain name of the OpenShift
installation.

With everything filled in, you may now click the "Create" button and your
application pods should start launching.

For extended discussions on creating objects through templates, please see
the following OpenShift documents:
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html#creating-from-templates-using-the-web-console[Creating from Templates Using the Web Console]
and
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/templates.html#creating-from-templates-using-the-cli[Creating from Templates Using the CLI].

[[usage]]
== Usage

Now that Ophicleide is running in your project it is time to begin training
models and executing queries against those models.

To begin with, you will need to navigate to the main web page for Ophicleide.
On the "Overview" page of you project, you will see a header for the
Ophicleide pod that should look similar to the following image:

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/route.png" alt="Add a route" class="img-responsive">]

_(Note, your route hostname should be different)_

Clicking on that link will take you to the landing page for the ophicleide-web
component. This page displays the training models that are available to run
queries against. As no models have been trained yet, it should be empty and
look like this:

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/usage1.png" alt="Ophicleide web" class="img-responsive usage">]

To start training a model, click on the "Train Model" button. This will bring
up a dialog where you will enter the name of the model and the URLs
containing the source text corpora. Here is an example with the modal dialog
filled out:

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/usage2.png" alt="Ophicleide train model" class="img-responsive usage">]

Click on the "Train" button in the dialog to begin the process of training a
Word2vec model against the source text corpora. After starting the training
your models page will change to look like the following image, with the
exception that your status will be "training". When the model training is
complete, the status will change to "ready".

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/usage3.png" alt="Ophicleide models" class="img-responsive usage">]

If you would like to verify that the ophicleide-training component is
running the Word2vec processing, you can use the OpenShift console to navigate
to the Pod view associated with Ophicleide and inspect the logs for the
ophicleide-training container. You should see something similar to the
following in the output:

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/logs.png" alt="Ophicleide training logs" class="img-responsive">]

When the model status is "ready", you can click on the "Create Query" button
to initiate a word query against that model. Enter a word that you would like
to find synonyms for within the corpus, and then click the "Query" button.

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/usage4.png" alt="Ophicleide create query" class="img-responsive usage">]

After clicking the "Query" button, the page view will change and you will
now be looking at the queries page. This page shows all the word queries
that have been run and the top 5 results in each query. You will notice
that each result in the query contains the similar word as well as the
vector associated with that word.

pass:[<img src="/assets/ophicleide/usage5.png" alt="Ophicleide query" class="img-responsive usage">]

If you would like to start another query, you can now use the "Create Query"
button on this page. As previously, you will enter a word to search for
similarities, and since we are now searching from the queries page you will
need to select the model to query against using the model select drop-down.

[[expansion]]
== Expansion

Although Ophicleide is functional and performs the tasks it was designed for,
there is always room for improvement and expansion. The following are a few
ideas for how Ophicleide could be expanded. These are suggested as possible
exercises for the reader and as a starting point to discuss how this type of
application can evolve.

1. Use Spark to process the queries. Currently, the vectors associated with
  each processed word are stored in a dictionary that the Ophicleide training
  component uses to return query results. There are facilities in the Word2vec
  package to use a Spark context for processing these type of searches.
  Adding this functionality would allow for the lookup workload to be taken
  off the training component, and provide a platform for deeper introspection
  of query results.

2. Separate the query engine into a service. A prominent consideration when
  designing cloud native applications is scale. How will an application grow
  to accommodate larger user bases. In the case of Ophicleide, separating out
  the query engine into a service of its own would give a graceful path to
  growth. By creating a new service specifically for queries it will become
  easier to add horizontal scalability by identifying the portions of the
  application which are being used the most and then replicating them.
