= deploy an Apache Spark cluster with the Oshinko WebUI?
:page-layout: howdoi
:page-menu_entry: How do I?

Deploying an Apache Spark cluster through the Oshinko WebUI is a simple
process requiring only a few options for most deployments. Once you have
deployed the Oshinko WebUI pod and visited its URL as exposed by OpenShift
you should see a page that looks similar to the following image:

To begin the Spark cluster deployment click on the "Deploy" button in the
upper left of the page. You will be presented with a modal dialog window that
looks similar to this:

Note: for details about the "Advanced cluster configuration", please see
the link:#advanced[section below].

You will now need to choose a name for your cluster and the initial number of
worker nodes that it should contain. As the name that is used will be an
identifier to OpenShift it must obey a few simple rules: it should be limited
to a maximum length of 253 characters, and should consist of only lower case
alphanumeric characters, `-`, and `.`.

The number of worker nodes that you choose will be highly dependent on the
type of work you are doing. You will be able to adjust this number after
launch without disrupting your driver application, as such it is safe to begin
with a smaller number of workers if you are unsure.

Once you have input a name and the number of workers click on the "Deploy"
button in the lower right of the dialog box to start the deployment.
Assuming there are no errors, you will see your cluster's status and details
on the Oshinko page, it will look similar to this:

== Advanced Cluster Configuration

In most cases you will not need to change the underlying details of your Spark
cluster beyond the name and number of workers. If, however, you find yourself
needing access to the Spark configurations, image details, or metrics options
then you will need to use the "Advanced cluster configuration" option
presented in the "Deploy cluster" dialog box.

While deploying your cluster, clicking on the "Advanced cluster configuration"
link in the "Deploy cluster" dialog will expand the dialog box to present the
following options:

pass:[<img src="/assets/howdoi/oshinko-webui-deploy-4.png" alt="Oshinko advanced options" class="img-responsive">]

From here you will be able to set any of the advanced options before launching
your cluster. Please note that these options (aside from the worker count)
cannot be adjusted after deploying the new Spark cluster.

You can always return the basic configuration and remove any advanced options
you have filled in by clicking on the "Basic cluster configuration" link at
the bottom the dialog.
