= launch a Jupyter notebook on OpenShift
:page-layout: howdoi

There are multiple ways to launch a Jupyter notebook on OpenShift with the
radanalytics.io tooling. You can use the OpenShift console or the `oc` command
line tool. Before running these instructions, you will need to have installed
the radanalytics.io manifest as referenced on the
link:/get-started[Get Started] page.

== Launching Jupyter from the OpenShift console

To begin, select the "Jupyter Notebook" template from the "Add to Project"
menu in your OpenShift console.

After selecting the template and clicking past the information screen, you
will be presented with several options for your notebook deployment. You will
need to create a password for your notebook and optionally give it a name and
the URI of an IPython notebook file to download.

After clicking "create" you will see the application deploy in your OpenShift
project, simply click on the route link created and you will be directed to
the notebook.

== Launching Jupyter from the command line

There are two methods for launching a Jupyter notebook from the command line:
by using the template or directly with `oc new-app` and the container image.

=== Template launch

The following command line will launch the template and create the necessary
route to access your notebook. Please note that you can change the parameter
options to customize your notebook launch.

....
oc new-app --template radanalytics-jupyter-notebook \
  -p NAME=my-notebook \
  -p JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD=secret
....

To pass a notebook URI, simply add the
`-p JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_X_INCLUDE=<your URI>` argument to your command.

=== Image launch

If you prefer a lower level option for creating your notebook, or have
other details that you need to specify, you can create the notebook
directly from the image source. To do this, simply use the following command:

....
oc new-app radanalyticsio/base-notebook \
  --name my-notebook \
  -e JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD=secret
....

Please note, in this example you will need to use the environment variable
option (`-e` or `--env`) for the `JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD` and
`JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_X_INCLUDE` arguments.

You will also need to manually create the route for the notebook.
