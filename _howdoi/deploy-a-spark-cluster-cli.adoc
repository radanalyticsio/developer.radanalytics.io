:page-layout: howdoi
:page-menu_entry: How do I?

Deploying an Apache Spark cluster through the Oshinko command line interface
tool is a simple process that in most cases can be done by providing only a
name for the new cluster.

.Prerequisites

* A terminal shell and OpenShift `oc` tool available with an active login to
  OpenShift.

* An OpenShift project with the radanalytics.io manifest installed, see the
  link:/get-started[Get Started] instructions for more help.

.Procedure

. Type `oshinko create <cluster name>` into your terminal shell, replacing
  `<cluster name>` with the name you will use to identify the cluster.

. Confirm your cluster is created by typing `oshinko get <cluster name>`,
  replacing `<cluster name>` with the name you chose for the cluster.
