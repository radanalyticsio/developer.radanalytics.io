= access the Apache Spark web interface?
:page-layout: howdoi
:page-menu_entry: How do I?

Apache Spark provides an HTML-based web interface that displays information
about the state of the processing cluster as well as applications that have
been run on the cluster.

After deploying an Apache Spark cluster with Oshinko, you will find its
associated resources (Pods, Services, Routes) in the OpenShift console. Using
this information you will navigate to the Spark cluster web interface.

.Prerequisites

* A web browser.

* An OpenShift console available.

* An Apache Spark cluster deployed by Oshinko.

.Procedure

. Navigate your browser to the OpenShift console and select the project that
  contains the Apache Spark cluster.

. Locate the master pod for your Apache Spark cluster, this can be found by
  looking for a resource that is identified by the name you chose for the
  cluster with `-m` appended to it.

. Expand the resource view associated with the Spark master pod to expose
  its details. It should look similar to this:

. Click on the link provided in the "NETWORKING" section that is associated
  with the route for the UI service. This service will have the name of your
  cluster with `-ui` appended to it. After clicking the link you will be
  navigated to the Spark master interface page which will look similar to this:
+
pass:[<img src="/assets/howdoi/spark-cluster-webui-2.png" alt="Spark master interface" class="img-responsive">]
