= How do I choose my own Apache Spark distribution?

When you install radanalytics.io, your project is set up to use a pre-determined distribution of Apache Spark. You can choose your own Apache Spark distribution with a few additional steps:

.Prerequisites

. Follow the instructions under link:/howdoi/install-radanalyticsio[How do I install radanalytics.io?]

. Choose an Apache Spark binary tarball like link:https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.3.0/spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz[this one]. You can download it or just use the url. Any binary distribution should work as long as it has this basic structure:

* a top-level directory we'll call TOP
* binaries under TOP/bin
* jar files under TOP/jars
* configuration files under TOP/conf

.Procedure

. Get the `rad-image` script from link:/assets/tools/rad-image[this link], or download it in your shell using curl:

    curl -o rad-image https://radanalytics.io/assets/tools/rad-image
    chmod +x rad-image
    ./rad-image -h

. Build images using the Spark distribution you've selected. This will create new `complete` tags on the radanaltyics.io image streams (it may take a while since it will build multiple images). Run `rad-image build -h` for additional information on the build command.

    ./rad-image build https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.3.0/spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz

. Make the radanalytics.io templates and configmaps use the `complete` tag

    ./rad-image use complete

. To use the default tags again, do this

    ./rad-image use -d

. To build images with a tag other than `complete`, specify the `-t TAG` option on the build command

    ./rad-image build -t 2.3.0 https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-2.3.0/spark-2.3.0-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz
    ./rad-image use 2.3.0
