:page-layout: howdoi
:page-menu_entry: How do I?

.Prerequisites

* A terminal shell and OpenShift `oc` tool available with an active login to
  OpenShift.

* An OpenShift project with radanalytics.io installed.

* A web browser available.

.Procedure

. Switch to the project with radanalytics.io installed by typing
  `oc project <project name>`, where `<project name>` is the name of the
  project with radanalytics.io installed.

. Type `oc new-app oshinko-webui` into your terminal shell. If you would
  prefer to use Oshinko with your OpenShift credentials (recommended for
  environments with public access) then type `oc new-app oshinko-webui-secure`
  instead.

. Type `oc get route oshinko-web` to find the exposed URL for the Oshinko
  web interface.

. Navigate your browser to the URL returned from the previous step. You should
  see a page that looks like this:
