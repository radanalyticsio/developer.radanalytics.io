Cryptocurrencies attract various groups of people. Among other it could be investors,
people from retail, tech enthusiasts, crypto-anarchists, etc. We are not going to
focus on anything else than the raw technology behind the Blockchain, leaving aside all
the ideology and hype that comes with the Bitcoin.

In this presentation we will show how the graph data can be processed in Spark. Blockchain binary
data is transformed into large graph of transactions so that we can work with the graph from Spark
using https://spark.apache.org/graphx/[GraphX] and https://graphframes.github.io/[GraphFrames] libraries.
The demo shows two notebooks with multiple examples of calculating interesting features
of the transaction graph.

The GraphX based notebook uses the https://github.com/spark-notebook/spark-notebook[spark-notebook]
as the notebook technology, while the second one uses GraphFrames and
https://github.com/jupyter/notebook[Jupyter] notebook. Also the second notebook
connects to an existing spark cluster that was created by Oshinko tools.
