The first meeting of the Big Data Special Interest Group, expanded on a previous Commons session entitled Big Data and Apache Spark on OpenShift (Part 1) which kicked off the Big Data SIG.

In the previous session, Red Hatâ€™s Will Benton gave us a vocabulary for talking about data-driven applications and outlined some example architectures for building data-driven applications with microservices. In this SIG session, he gave us an introduction to using Apache Spark on OpenShift and walk through an example data-driven application.
