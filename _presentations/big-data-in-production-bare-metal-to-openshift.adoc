Apache Spark is one of the most exciting open-source data-processing frameworks today. It features a range of useful capabilities and an unusually developer-friendly programming model. However, the ease of getting a simple Spark application running can hide some of the challenges you might face while going from a proof of concept to a real-world application. This talk will distill our experiences as early adopters of Spark in production, present a case study where using Spark effectively provided huge benefits over legacy solutions, explain why we migrated from a dedicated Spark cluster to OpenShift, and provide concrete advice regarding:

* how to integrate Spark with external data sources (including databases, in-memory data grids, and message queues),
* how best to deploy and manage Spark in the cloud,
* the tradeoffs of various archive storage options for Spark,
* how to evaluate predictive models and make sense of the analytic components of insightful applications, and
* integrating Spark into microservice applications on OpenShift

This talk assumes some familiarity with Apache Spark but will provide context for attendees who are new to Spark. Youâ€™ll learn from a seasoned Red Hat engineer with over three years of experience running Spark in production and contributing to the Spark community.
