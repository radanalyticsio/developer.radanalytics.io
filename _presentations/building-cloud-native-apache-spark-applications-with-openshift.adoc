Apache Spark based applications are often comprised of many separate, interconnected components that are a good match for an orchestrated containerized platform like OpenShift which is built on Kubernetes. But with the increased flexibility afforded by these technologies comes a new set of challenges for building rich data-centric applications. Mike starts off with how to build Apache Spark Application pipelines and then walks thru a demo of building one on OpenShift. He also gave some great insights into the road ahead for Apache Spark on OpenShift.
