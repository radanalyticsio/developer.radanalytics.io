== Overview

The radanalytics.io projects are all focused on increasing your ability to
design, deploy, and maintain insightful data-driven applications. The
foundation of this effort are infrastructure projects which simplify the
process of deploying and managing data processing frameworks.

This introduction will help you learn about the primary radanalytics.io
projects, how to install them, and how to utilize them with your own
applications.

== Which projects should you start with?

Although the link:/projects[projects] page contains all the collected efforts of
the radanalytics.io community, there are several applications which deserve to
be highlighted as they are key to beginning your journey here.

=== Oshinko

The Oshinko project covers several individual applications which all focus on
the goal of deploying and managing https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark]
clusters on https://www.openshift.com[Red Hat OpenShift] and
https://www.openshift.org[OpenShift Origin].

With the Oshinko family of applications you can create, scale, and destroy
Apache Spark clusters. These clusters can then be used by your applications
within an OpenShift project by providing a simple connection URL to the
cluster. There are multiple paths to achieving this: browser based graphical
interface, command line tool, and a RESTful server.

To begin your exploration, we recommend starting with the
https://github.com/radanalyticsio/oshinko-webui[oshinko-webui] application.
The oshinko-webui is a self-contained deployment of the Oshinko technologies.
An OpenShift user can deploy the oshinko-webui container into their project
and then access the server with a web browser. Through the browser interface
you will be able to manage Apache Spark clusters within your project.

Another important part of Oshinko to highlight is the
https://github.com/radanalyticsio/oshinko-s2i[oshinko-s2i] repository and
associated images which implement the
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[source-to-image]
workflow for Apache Spark based applications. These images enable
you to create full applications that can be built, deployed and upgraded
directly from a source repository.

== Quickstart with Oshinko

=== 1. Connect to an OpenShift cluster

Download the https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[oc command]
and login to an existing cluster with `oc login`. Alternatively,
https://www.openshift.org/#try[setup your own cluster] with `oc cluster up` or the
https://www.openshift.org/minishift[Minishift] tool(Windows and Mac users
may find this option easiest to start).
Oshinko version 0.4.0 and newer require origin 3.6.0.

=== 2. Install and setup Oshinko

First, install all the Oshinko resources into your project using the following
command:

....
oc create -f https://radanalytics.io/resources.yaml
....

This creates the latest versions of the Oshinko S2I (source-to-image)
templates and the Oshinko Web UI application, as well as a ServiceAccount and
RoleBinding needed for creation and management of Apache Spark clusters.
Look https://github.com/radanalyticsio/radanalyticsio.github.io/tree/master/openshift[here]
for instructions on how to use components from a specific Oshinko release.

Second, start the Oshinko Web UI application with this command:

....
oc new-app --template=oshinko-webui
....

This creates the Oshinko Web UI, which can be used to manually create and manage Apache Spark clusters.

Alternatively, if you would prefer to use Oshinko with your OpenShift credentials
(recommended for environments with public access) you can run the following to
start a secure Oshinko Web UI:

....
oc new-app --template=oshinko-webui-secure
....

At this point you should visit your
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/architecture/infrastructure_components/web_console.html[OpenShift Console]
with a web browser, locate the Oshinko Web UI route URL, and begin exploring
the Oshinko Web UI.

=== 3. Begin using Apache Spark on OpenShift

Now that you have Oshinko installed and running in your OpenShift project you
might want to learn how deploy an Apache Spark cluster by reading
link:/howdoi/deploy-a-spark-cluster-webui[this article]. We also recommend
investigating the many link:/tutorials[tutorials] that the radanalytics.io
community have produced. These tutorials will show you how to fully utilize
the intelligent application development workflow with Oshinko and OpenShift.
