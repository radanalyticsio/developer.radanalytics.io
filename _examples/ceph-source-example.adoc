[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Processing data stored in an external object store is a practical and
popular way for an intelligent application to operate.

This is an example of the key pieces needed to connect your
application to data in Ceph using S3 API. It is presented as steps in a Jupyter
notebook. To run this example, you need a Ceph environment running in your network
and a running Spark cluster in your OpenShift project.
Optionally, you can run in your own computer using `ceph-nano`
(check the <<prerequisites>> section if you need to deploy a local instance of Ceph).

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

In case you need to configure your own Ceph environment, follow the steps below:

1. Download `ceph-nano` in your computer:

  curl -L https://github.com/ceph/cn/releases/download/v1.6.1/cn-v1.6.1-b900468-linux-amd64 -o cn \
  && chmod +x cn

2. Create the Ceph cluster:

  ./cn cluster start ceph-source -d /tmp

3. After `cn cluster start` finish, you will receive the URL to access your newly created Ceph cluster and your S3 credentials.

4. Access the Ceph Nano Web Console with address `http://<your-ip-address>:5000`. The figure below shows the Web console page:

5. We need to create a bucket and add a file so that the Jupyter notebook can access it. Let's first create a bucket: Click on the `Create Bucket` button and type `ceph-source` in the `Bucket Name` field:
pass:[<img src="/assets/ceph-source-example/ceph-source-2.png" class="img-responsive">]

6. Now we have a bucket, and we need to upload a file. Click on the `ceph-source` we just created. The page below is shown:
pass:[<img src="/assets/ceph-source-example/ceph-source-3.png" class="img-responsive">]

7. Click on `Upload` button and select the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/spark/master/README.md[README.md] file from the Spark distribution. *Note:* This file is just an example, you can upload whatever text file you want, but expect different results from this tutorial.

8. After selecting the file, the `Upload Status` dialog will show the upload progress until the `Uploaded` status is presented. Now we can continue with preparing the environment to access from the Jupyter notebook.

If you want to stop the ceph-nano cluster, type the following command:

  ./cn cluster stop ceph-source

== Architecture

No architecture, this is a connectivity example.

[[installation]]
== Installation

1. From the OpenShift developer console, visit the Oshinko web interface. Use the 
   interface to create a new cluster, and take note of what youâ€™ve called this cluster.

2. Start a Jupyter notebook with the commands:

  oc new-app rimolive/base-notebook \
    -e JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PASSWORD=supersecret \
    -e JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_X_INCLUDE=https://radanalytics.io/assets/ceph-source-example/ceph-source-example.ipynb
  oc expose svc/base-notebook

3. Open the Jupyter URL created by OpenShift and type the password you set in the previous command.

4. Look for the notebook named `ceph-source-example.ipynb`, open it and follow the instructions. Make sure in the line where the notebook connects to the spark cluster you changed with the cluster name you used in step 1 and in the line where you set up the Ceph connection you change with the IP where you Ceph instance is running.
