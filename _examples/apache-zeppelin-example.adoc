[[introduction]]
== Introduction

http://zeppelin.apache.org/[Apache Zeppelin] is an alternative to project http://jupyter.org/[Jupyter] 
to provide a notebook to run analysis over data and plot graphs in order 
to show to end users an overview about the data or even doing some exploratory
analysis and plot some graphs using the data.

This example shows how to use the Zeppelin OpenShift template created to run on top of
OpenShift, as well as provide an example notebook to run on top of your OpenShift cluster.

[[architecture]]
== Architecture

The central piece is the Apache Zeppelin pod, used to create notebooks. From Zeppelin we 
will connect to the Spark cluster managed by the Oshinko project and run some analysis. This
example will use a pod for the Zeppelin instance and two other pods for the Apache Spark 
cluster (1 master and 1 worker).

[[installation]]
== Installation

Installing this notebook is straightforward; you simply need to
create an OpenShift project, deploy a Spark cluster in that project, and
install and run the notebook image.

=== Prerequisites

Follow the link:/get-started[Get Started] instructions
to create an OpenShift project with the Oshinko web interface running.

=== Setting up a cluster

From the OpenShift developer console, visit the Oshinko web interface. Use the
interface to create a new cluster, and take note of what you've called this
cluster.

=== Setting up the Zeppelin template

In the same project, add the Zeppelin template with the following command:

....
    oc create -f https://radanalytics.io/assets/zeppelin-example/zeppelin-openshift.yaml
....

After adding the template, create the Zeppelin application with the following command:

....
    oc new-app --template=$namespace/apache-zeppelin-openshift \
        --param=APPLICATION_NAME=apache-zeppelin \
        --param=GIT_URI=https://github.com/rimolive/zeppelin-notebooks.git \
        --param=ZEPPELIN_INTERPRETERS=md
....

After running the command above, a build will be triggered to add the notebooks hosted 
in the Git repository specified in the GIT_URI parameter, as well as copy the configuration
files and install the md interpreter. The md interpreter is used to write Markdown blocks
in zeppelin.

When the build finishes, it will deploy the newly built Zeppelin image. Click on the hostname
defined in the apache-zeppelin app. In case you don't see a URL for Zeppelin, check if a route
is create with the command:

....
    oc get route
....

[[usage]]
== Usage

Apache Zeppelin can create powerful notebooks to run exploratory analysis from 
the data you want to handle, as well as design dashboards to monitor the quality
of your data or measurements that will drive a decision based on what is analyzed.

When you access the Zeppelin app, you will see a `Untitled Note 1` notebook. This is
the example notebook from the GitHub repo specified in the GIT_URI parameter:

pass:[<img src="/assets/zeppelin-example/zeppelin2.png" class="img-responsive">]

When you open the notebook, you will see some paragraphs (some are Markdown and others
are Python). You can run individually each paragraphs or you can click on the `Run all 
paragraphs` button to run the whole notebook. Just for learning purpose, I'd suggest
run all paragraphs and see the result:

pass:[<img src="/assets/zeppelin-example/zeppelin3.png" class="img-responsive">]

This notebook will connect to the Apache Spark cluster, create an RDD based on data(in
the example notebook, the Apache Zeppelin README.md file) and run a simple word count. All
processing will be run on the Spark cluster.

[[expansion]]
== Expansion

To make the example better, the notebook can add some plots to show the data, as
well as use forms to make the plots interactive.
