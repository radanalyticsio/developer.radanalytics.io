# Archived resources.yaml versions

This is a list of resource files that
can be used to install templates for specific Oshinko releases.
Each file is listed below with the Oshinko release it
installs by default and other releases which it supports.

# Changing the release installed by a resources file 

A `resources.yaml` file can be changed to create templates
for any supported Oshinko release. This is done by modifying
the tags on the Oshinko images referenced in the file. You
can do this with a text editor and then pass the resulting file
to *oc create*, or you can use shell commands like this:

```bash
# The url of the resources.yaml you wish to use
RESOURCES_URL=https://radanalytics.io/resources.yaml

# The default tag that file uses for Oshinko images (listed below)
DEFAULT_TAG=stable

# The Oshinko version to use as the new tag (v9.9.9 is made up)
NEW_TAG=v9.9.9

# Create a modified file and pass it directly to oc create
wget $RESOURCES_URL -qO - \
| sed -r -e "s@(radanalyticsio/.*:)($DEFAULT_TAG)@\1$NEW_TAG@" | oc create -f -
```
