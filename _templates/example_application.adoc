[[introduction]]
== Introduction

Add an introduction about your application here, what it does, what the
user will expect, and any other general high level information. For examples
of other applications, see the `_applications` directory. All the sections
of this document that are delineated with `[[identifier]]` blocks are the mandatory
sections. Please do not edit them as out as the page framework depends on
the internal links. This document uses the AsciiDoc format and you are free
to use any of the available markup (see http://asciidoc.org/).

The AsciiDoc attribute entity blocks defined after the document title are
important for displaying information about the application on the site. The
most important variables to fill out while creating your documentation are:
`page-link`, `page-description` and `page-project_links`.

* `page-link` is the name that will be used internally when generating the site,
  it has meaning for the directory structure and links that will be created,
  it should be a single continuous word with no spaces (underscores and
  hyphens are acceptable)
* `page-description` is the text that will be used on the tutorials page to
  describe your application
* `page-project_links` is an array of links that will be displayed on the tutorials
  page with your application, add any links to your source material here
  (links should be enclosed by quotes "http://link")
* `page-menu_items` is an array that aids in the construction of the menu links
  on the application page. The current options are: `lightning`.
* `page-labels` is an array of strings that describe the primary technologies in
  use within the application (eg Python, ActiveMQ, S3).

If you need to add graphics or other assets to your application page, please
make a directory under the top level `assets` directory. This new directory
should have the same name that you supplied in the front matter `page-link`
variable. You may reference your assets as follows:

```
image:/assets/example_application/my_image.png[Alt text]
```

or, if you need to add a custom class to your `img` element

```
pass:[<img src="/assets/example_application/my_image.png" alt="Alt text" class="img-responsive">]
```

Assets may be used in your slide decks as well, using the same link
references. For example:

```
link:/assets/example_application/my_yaml_file.yaml[My YAML file]
```
